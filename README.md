# studygiggle
the goal here is to make a website that you can use to view Snap<i>!</i> projects loaded thru Google Drive. <br>
here's the current method:
* person 1 creates a project, downloads the xml file, uploads it to Google Drive, sets permissions to anyone with the link can view
* person 1 creates another project with a variable called "driveID" containing that file's ID
* person 2 accesses the studygiggle website and views the project stored on Google Drive on the studygiggle website after getting the project with the variable's url
